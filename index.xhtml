<li>Higgs Boson: subatomic particle</li>
<li>Proposed in 1964 by Peter Higgs, not yet observed in experiments</li>
<li>Fundamental particle expected by the theories we use to understand particle physics</li>
<li>We've seen pretty much everything else</li>
<li>To observe the Higgs, need lots and lots of energy</li>

<ul>
<li>Collisions in accelerator observed by detectors</li>
<li>At LHC, two main detector collaborations: CMS, ATLAS</li>
<li>Compete, verify each other's findings</li>
<li>Detectors are like big cameras</li>

<ul>
<li>Millions of silicon and optical sensors wrapped around the accelerator tube</li>
<li>Gather evidence (particle tracks, energy) to identify what was produced in collision</li>
</ul>

<h1>Sorting the unknown from the boring</h1>
</header>

<ul>
<li>Most of what is produced in a collision is well-understood (ie. boring)</li>
<li>Each event generates 1 MB of data; crossings happen 40,000,000 times a second</li>
<li>Can't store or process all of that data, so we throw most of it out</li>

<li>Fast hardware triggers</li>
<ul>
<li>Custom FPGAs (designed and built at Wisconsin for CMS)</li>
<li>Discard 999 of every 1000 events
<li>Send 50,000 events per second by fiber to software triggers</li>
</ul>

<li>High Level trigger</li>
<ul>
<li>Software selectors (some also built at Wisconsin)</li>
<li>Run on a Linux cluster</li>
<li>Reduce data again by 1000x, archive 100 events per second to tape</li>
<li>About 50ms to make each selection</li>
</ul>

hi, my name is will maier and i work in the physics department at the university of wisconsin.
i'm here to talk about linux, but i'll have to cover a bit of physics first.
at this point, i should probably mention that i'm not a physicist myself; if you happen to be one, please feel free to step in at any point.

my group at the university is part of a large collaboration of scientists, engineers and computer folk around the world that are working on the largest science project ever.
we're trying to measure a subatomic particle that we're pretty sure exists, even though nobody has been able to observe one.
the particle is called the higgs boson; its existence was first proposed in 1964 (by peter higgs).
that year, several independent groups of physicists all arrived at a mechanism to explain why some elementary particles have mass and others don't.

since then, the higgs mechanism has become a key part of the standard model of particle physics, the set of theories that do a very good job of explaining experimental results.
we haven't yet observed the higgs boson itself, though, but we have some clues: we know roughly what it should look like, how much mass and energy it should have, and we know the conditions (high energy particle collisions) that should produce it.

lots of evidence gathered since then has made this mechanism
